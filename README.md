# atoptsim
Inspired by bowsim and halosim at https://www.atoptics.co.uk/

Currently just a very basic ray-tracer.

A lot of code is shamelessly copied from [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).

## Building

Requires a C++ 14 conformant compiler (though only tested with GCC 11)

```
cmake -B build
cd build
make
```
